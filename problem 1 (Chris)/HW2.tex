  \item\label{Q1} Select a continuous distribution (Not the uniform or exponential). 
  It does not have to be one that we cover in the notes! To explore the PDF of your 
  distribution, specify two sets of parameter(s) for your distribution.

  \item \textbf{History} Discuss what types of random variables are modeled with 
  your distribution. Be sure to include a discussion about the support and ensure 
  to provide the density function, and CDF. This requires some internet research 
  -- what's the history of the distribution, why was it created and named? What 
  are some exciting applications of this distribution?
  
  Cite all of your sources in LaTeX by adding a BibTeX citation to the .bib file. 
  To help, I've cited R \citep{R21} in parentheses here. \cite{R21} provides helpful 
  tools for the rest of the questions below. BibTeX citations are available through 
  Google Scholar by clicking the cite button below the article of  interest and 
  selecting the BibTeX option.\\
  
  \textbf{Solution:}\\
  Our group has chosen to use a normal distribution for the \texttt{Q1} and \texttt{Q2}!\\
  To start with, I will define what a normal distribution is. A continuous variable X has a normal distribution — with mean $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ — X ~ N($\mu, \sigma^2)$, if it has the following properties:\\
  		\begin{equation*}
	\mu \in \mathbb{R}; \sigma \in \mathbb{R}^+
	\tag{\textbf{Parameters}}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\begin{equation*}
	X = \{x:x\in\mathbb{R}\}
	\tag{\textbf{Support}}
	\end{equation*}
  	
  	\begin{equation*}
	f_{X}({x|\mu,\sigma})=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \tag{\textbf{PDF}}\\
	\end{equation*}
	
	\begin{equation*}
	F_{X}({x|\mu,\sigma})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \tag{\textbf{CDF}}
	\end{equation*}
  
  \textbf{Description:} Normal distribution is one of the most important distributions in the world of statistics, and it's used in many fields. The graph of this probability function is a symmetric, bell-shaped curved. Symmetry of this function implies that its mean is going to be equal to its median value. We are going to prove it later on. \\
  \textbf{History:} One of the first major great discoveries in the field of statistics happened in 1713, as Jacob Bernoulli published his work on proving the Weak Law of Large Numbers. According to \cite{patel1996handbook}, initially normal distribution appeared in 1733 as an approximation to the probability for sums of binominally distributed quantities to lie between two values. \\
  \textbf{Today:} According to \cite{ahsanullah2014normal}, normal distribution plays an important role in many applied problems in biology, economics, engineering, genetics, hydrology, mechanics, medicine, number theory, statistics, physics, psychology and so on.

  %%%%%%%%%  Part (b)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item Show that you have a valid PDF. You will find the \texttt{integrate()} 
	function in \texttt{R} helpful.\\
	
	\textbf{Solution:}\\
	Here's the equation of PDF for normal distribution!
	\begin{equation*}
	f_{X}({x|\mu,\sigma})=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \tag{\textbf{PDF}}
	\end{equation*}
	Now, let's prove that it's valid!\\
	Since normal (or gaussian — whatever you prefer!) distribution is a continous probability distribution, it implies that the area under the curve is equal to 1 (or 100\%!). This statement takes its roots from the second Kolmogorov axiom that states that the entirety of sample space is equal to one.\\
	Therefore, let's use CDF to prove that our PDF formula is going to return one! Since the support for normal distribution contain all rational numbers, our integral is going to be from negative infinity to positive infinity. 
	\begin{equation*}
	F_{X}({x|\mu,\sigma})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \tag{\textbf{CDF}}
	\end{equation*}
	I am going to use \texttt{integrate()} function in order to compute this equation.

	\item Find the median for your two sets of parameter(s). Conduct some research 
	to find the median based on our PDF to confirm that your numerical approach is 
	correct. \\
	
	\textbf{Solution:}\\
	As we have established in part \texttt{(a)} of this problem, one of the key features of the normal distribution is the fact that it's symmetrical. Let's set out to prove it through the direct proof!\\
		Let \texttt{m} be median!
		\begin{equation*}
	P(X\le m)=P(X\ge m)=\frac{1}{2}
	\tag{\textbf{Definition of the median}}
	\end{equation*}
	Let normal distribution be symmetric. If it's symmetric, then the statement $\mu=m$ holds true.\\
	Therefore, the following equation should also hold true:
	\begin{equation*}
\int_{-\infty}^{\mu}\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}=
\int_{\mu}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}=
\frac{1}{2}
\tag{\textbf{Assumption}}
	\end{equation*}
	
	Let's check it through R!

It would appear that $\mu=m!$ Therefore, mean is equal to median within the normal distribution. Therefore, since $\mu_{1}=1$ and $\mu_{2}=-2$, the medians are 1 and -2 respectively!

As we can see on Figure \ref{plot1}, changing our parameters does indeed change the graph we have. Changing the $\mu$ transforms graph to the right (if the mean is positive) and to the left (if the mean is negative). Changing $\sigma$ changes the kurtosis of the graph. Thus, distributions with lower value of $\sigma$ show higher peaks.

We see that Figure \ref{plot2} is a graph of CDF function with different sets of parameters. This function shows the probability that a probability that a random variable X will take a value less than or equal to $x$. We can see that our PDF is valid, for when we went over all values of X, the probability is $1.00$ or 100\%. Changing the value of $\mu$ changes the position of a graph (moves it to the right or to the left), while the change in $\sigma$ increases the slope of the function: the higher the value of $\sigma$, the faster the function will go over all the values and reach 100\%.

As we can see, the bigger sample we have, the closer the resulting histogram is to the real density function that we built on our set of parameters. We can notice that it's particularly true for $n>30$.\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Our PDF is such a good fit for the data because we are using \texttt{rnorm()} function that randomly generates numbers for the normal distribution. 
  \item A good fit can also be explained via Central Limit Theorem: as our sample enlarges, the distribution of our random variable follows a normal distribution.

%%%%%%%%%  Question 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item\label{Q3} Select a discrete distribution (not the Poisson). It does not 
  have to be one that we cover in the notes! To explore the PMF of your distribution, 
  specify two sets of parameter(s) for your distribution.
  \begin{enumerate}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (a)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item \textbf{History} Discuss what types of random variables are modeled with 
  your distribution. Be sure to include a discussion about the support and ensure
  to provide the mass function, and CDF. This requires some internet research -- 
  what's the history of the distribution, why was it created and named? What are
  some exciting applications of this distribution? Cite all of your sources.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (b)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item Show that you have a valid PMF. You can show this approximately by 
	calculating the series in a repeat loop until probability mass evaluations are 
	infinitesimally small.
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (c)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item Find the median for your two sets of parameter(s). Conduct some research 
	to find the median based on our PMF to confirm that your numerical approach is
	correct. 
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (d)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item \label{q3PMF} Graph the PMF for several values of the parameter(s) 
	including the two sets you specified. What does changing the parameter(s) do 
	to the shape of the PMF?
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (e)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	 \item Graph the CDF for the same values of the parameter(s) as you did in 
	 Question \ref{q3PMF}. What does changing the parameter(s) do to the shape of 
	 the CDF? Comment on the aspects of the CDFs that show that the CDF is valid.
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (f)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item Generate a random sample of size $n=10, 25, 100$, and $1000$ for your 
  two sets of parameter(s). In a $4 \times 2$ grid, plot a histogram (with bin 
  size 1) of each set of data and superimpose the true mass function at the 
  specified parameter values. Interpret the results.
